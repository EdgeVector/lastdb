# Observability docs

Operator-facing documentation for the `observability` crate
(`crates/observability`). Designed for someone bringing up a new fold_db
node, debugging trace propagation, or tuning what reaches Sentry.

## Implementation notes (one per phase / sweep)

These are working notes, not a tutorial. Each documents the decisions
behind a phase of the observability rollout so future contributors can
see *why* something was wired the way it is.

- [tokio::spawn instrumentation](tokio-spawn-instrument-notes.md) — Phase 3 / T6.
  Where `.instrument(Span::current())` was applied to keep trace context
  across spawn boundaries.
- [LoggingSystem retirement](loggingsystem-retirement-notes.md) — Phase 3 / T7.
  Removal of the legacy `LoggingSystem` and the last `log` crate
  references.
- [Egress classification](egress-classification-notes.md) — Phase 2 / T4.
  `// trace-egress: <class>` comments at HTTP call sites and which calls
  do or don't get `inject_w3c` wrapping.
- [Redaction lint](redaction-lint.md) — Phase 5 / T1. CI guard that fails
  if a `tracing` macro emits a sensitive field as a raw value instead of
  through `redact!()` / `redact_id!()`.
- [Spawn-instrument lint](spawn-instrument-lint.md) — Phase 5 / T2. CI
  guard that fails if a `tokio::spawn` site does not pair with
  `.instrument(Span::current())`.
- [Structured-fields lint](structured-fields-lint.md) — Phase 5 / T3-T4.
  CI guard against `tracing` macros that smuggle dynamic data through
  the message string instead of structured fields.
- [Tracing-egress lint](tracing-egress-lint.md) — Phase 5 / T3. CI guard
  pairing every `reqwest` call site with the matching
  `// trace-egress: <class>` annotation.
- [Cloud Sync backlog Sentry signal](cloud-sync-backlog-sentry.md) —
  incident signal emitted when repeated R2 transfer failures coincide with
  pending-depth thresholds, including the safe fields operators can pivot on.
