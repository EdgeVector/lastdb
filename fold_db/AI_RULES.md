Project Settings

- use ./run to start the server, it will kill all other db proccesses and start the front and back end. It runs on port 9001.
- no custom url endpoints, all UI endpoints derived using OpenAPI

Coding standards. Follow these to avoid creating spagetti code.

- No silent failures. Throw errors if anything goes wrong.
- No branching logic -- think harder if it seems like there's going to be branching logic.
- Don't use JSON return types.
- Don't make assumptions that test failures were preexisting. Assume all tests were passing before.
- use TODO format for anything not fully implemented.
- Don't use inline crate imports, import in headers only to keep code clean.
- Keep imports organized.
- Don't create fallbacks.
- validate your changes -- in the browser.
